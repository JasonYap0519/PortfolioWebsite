# PortfolioWebsite
A website that showcases my basic information and previous projects. I believe that every developer should have its own portfolio website that demonstrates their work to their future employer. A portfolio is important to leave a good first impression to recruiters. I builted this website from scratch because as a Computer Science student, I wanted to apply the technical skills that I had learned throughout my degree.

This is a website that is built using <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
